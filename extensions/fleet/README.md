# fleet

FleetView lists agents, monitors and running shells below the editor. Open an agent or monitor directly; select a shell from the shared shell row to see its log. FleetView also delivers work notices to the model. Spec: #29.

- The first row is the main session. Agents and monitors follow; nested items are indented under their parent. Each agent's activity or result sits on an indented `└─` line attached to its row.
- Running background shells share one row: `N shells running in background`. Enter or click to choose a running shell, then view its log. The row disappears when the last shell finishes. An open log stays open until you go back.
- Agent and monitor rows show kind and label, then their details, with status and running time last so the steadier fields keep their place. Monitors show their latest activity or result before the status. A finished agent shows its result on the linked line.
- An item's detail fields, such as an agent's model, thinking level, tokens and cost, follow its status. On a narrow row they drop from the right. The label is shortened with `…` so the status always shows. An agent's linked activity remains visible.
- A finished agent or monitor leaves its row after 10 seconds. A finished shell leaves the shared shell row at once. Finished items stay in the registry while selected, open in the viewer or above running work; the 10 seconds start when that ends. Sending a prompt removes nothing.
- FleetView shows at most 6 lines. A `… N more` line counts hidden items; the list scrolls by whole items, keeping an agent and its activity together.
- FleetView is hidden when there are no visible agents, monitors or running shells.
- Terminal control sequences are stripped from every row. An agent or monitor whose activity throws shows `activity failed`.

## Viewer

- Enter or a click on an agent or monitor row shows it in place of the chat. Click an agent's activity line to open the same agent. Enter or click the shell row to pick a running shell and open its log. `●` marks the item on screen, and focus stays on its row (`›`).
- Up, Down and Enter on another row switch straight to it. Enter on `main` returns to the chat, with focus on `main`.
- Esc in FleetView returns to the prompt with the item still open, so typing steers it. A second Esc closes it.
- While FleetView has focus, a dim line under its rows gives its keys: `Enter to view · x to stop · ctrl+x ctrl+k to stop all agents`. It counts toward the 6 lines. On the shell row, `x` lets you choose which running shell to stop. A stop uses the item's own `stop()`, so its notice and decay work as usual.
- A shell job or monitor shows its log file, read as it grows, with colors kept and other control sequences stripped. An agent shows its transcript.
- Main-session output keeps going to the chat while you view an item, so you see it when you return.
- The viewer follows new output. Scrolling up pauses it, and End jumps back to the end and follows again.
- What you type while viewing an agent steers it and shows in the viewer, echoed by the viewer unless the item's transcript shows its steers itself (`showsSteers`). Other items take no steering. Slash commands still go to Pi; nothing else reaches the main session.
- The viewer stays open when its item finishes, and closes once the item is removed. In fullscreen, once nothing else is running, FleetView draws a dim `viewing <kind> <label> · esc back` line so the way back stays on screen even if the header has scrolled off with a long log.
- The chat swap reaches into Pi's layout, and only fullscreen mode has the scroll view it needs. In regular mode, or if Pi's layout differs from the probed shape, the viewer opens as a full-size overlay instead. Switching to regular mode while an item is swapped in moves it to the overlay. The overlay has its own steer line, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End and the mouse wheel scroll it, and while scrolled up its header counts the lines below.
- A log shows at most its last 2,000 lines. Each read takes at most 1 MiB, and a line says how many bytes it skipped.

## Notices

- An agent's completion shows in the chat as one themed line: `✓ agent scout · done 5s · found 3 files`.
- A failed (`✗`) or stopped (`■`) notice shows the whole error or reason under that line, with nothing to expand.
- A finished shell job or monitor draws no notice: its result already reached the model,
  and the tool groups around it stay collapsed. Failures, stops and running warnings
  still show.
- A notice that arrives while the session is idle starts a turn. One that arrives during a turn joins it at the next step, so notices that arrive together share one turn.

## Ending with work running

Applies only to runs without the UI, which includes every child session.

- When the run is about to end with items it owns still running or queued, the model gets one message listing them (kind, label, ID, status, running time), and the run continues.
- After that, the run waits for each remaining item and continues with its notice, until none is left. The wait has no time limit.
- Switching or forking the session ends the wait. A plain abort does not, because Pi reports no event for it: stop the items the session owns, or dispose the session through its shutdown path.

Interactive sessions end their runs as usual: their work keeps running and its notices start new turns.

## Ctrl+B

Ctrl+B moves every running foreground command, such as a shell command, into the background. While one can be moved, its call in the chat shows `ctrl+b to run in background` (#139); nothing shows under the editor.

Ctrl+B works only while Pi's editor has focus: a picker, dialog or overlay keeps the key.

Pi binds Ctrl+B to cursor left by default. To free it, add this to `keybindings.json` in Pi's agent directory:

```json
"tui.editor.cursorLeft": ["left"]
```

Until then Ctrl+B keeps moving the cursor, the hint never shows, and a warning names the line to add. It shows at startup, or at the next key once a `/reload` blocks Ctrl+B again, and never twice in a row.

## Keys

| Key | When | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Down or Left | Empty prompt | Focuses FleetView, on the open item, or on `main` when none is open |
| Up / Down | FleetView focused | Moves the selection |
| Enter | FleetView focused | Opens the selected row |
| x | FleetView focused | Stops the selected running or queued item. On the shell row, choose the shell first |
| Ctrl+X, then Ctrl+K | FleetView focused | Stops every running or queued agent this session started, with its subagents; jobs and monitors keep running |
| Esc | FleetView focused | Returns to the prompt; an open item stays open |
| Click | Fullscreen mode | Opens the row, like Enter |
| Esc | Viewing an item, at the prompt | Returns to the chat |
| End | Viewing an item | Jumps to the end and follows again |
| Ctrl+B | A foreground command runs | Moves every foreground command into the background |

Typing at a non-empty prompt is never captured.

## Tools, commands and settings

None.

## Producer interface

Other extensions import the registry from `shared/fleet` and never draw UI. It lives on a `globalThis` symbol, so it is one instance however Pi loads each extension.

```ts
import { fleet } from "../../shared/fleet/index.ts";

fleet().register({
  id: "job-1",                    // any id but "main", which is the main session's row
  owner: ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId(), // the session that started it: gets its notices, waits for it
  kind: "shell",                  // "agent", "shell" or "monitor"
  label: "npm test",
  parentId: "agent-1",            // optional: shows the row under that item
  activity: () => lastLine,       // required: the row's latest activity, read on every render
  detail: () => ["kid-1", "low"], // optional: fields shown after the status, read on every render
  view: { log: logPath },         // required: a log file, or { transcript: (tui, ui) => component, showsSteers? };
                                  // a transcript is built on each open, and its dispose(), if any, runs on close
  stop: () => child.kill(),       // required
  steer: undefined,               // optional, agents only
});
fleet().update("job-1");                              // redraw the activity line
fleet().update("job-1", { label: "npm test --watch" }); // ignored once finished
fleet().finish("job-1", "completed", "12 tests passed");  // notice: a default line built from the item
fleet().finish("job-1", "failed", "exit 1\nError: boom",  // the user's summary: a failure's error, in full
  "shell job-1 failed (exit 1). Log: /tmp/job-1.log");    // the model's notice, in your own wording
fleet().finish("job-1", "completed", "done", null);       // no notice: the model already has the result
fleet().notify("job-1", "build 42 passed");              // a notice while running, such as a monitor line

const end = fleet().foreground(owner, () => moveToBackground()); // Ctrl+B calls this; dropped if it throws
end(); // once the command ends or is backgrounded; the owner's session shutdown drops it too
```

A notice goes to the owner session only. One sent before that session attaches is held until it does, up to the latest 50. Once the session shuts down, or its delivery throws because it was disposed, its notices are dropped.
