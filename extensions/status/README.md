# status

A two-line footer, and quota headroom from QuotaBar.app's loopback feed
(`http://127.0.0.1:<quotaPort>/quotas`). One client with a cache serves the
footer, the tool and the command; concurrent requests share one fetch. If
QuotaBar.app is not running, all three say so plainly. No quota text is added
to agent runs.

## Footer

TUI sessions only; it replaces Pi's footer.

```
model thinking  │  in 12k out 3.4k cache 81% $0.412  │  ctx [███░░░░░░░] 31%
~/repo main*  │  Q claude 78%/41% · codex 12%  │  TTFT 820ms · TPS 64.2
```

- Usage totals cover the current branch (replies, tool results, compactions)
  and update per message, not per draw. Tokens and cost also count every
  subagent once it finishes, its own children included.
- Context turns amber at 70% and red at 90%; a provider's quota turns amber
  below 50% left and red below 20% in its lowest bucket.
- `*` marks uncommitted changes. `git status` runs in the background at
  session start and 300 ms after the last tool call, one git at a time per
  process, only in trusted projects, and is stopped on shutdown. A git still
  running after 5 s gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL 2 s later; a timed-out
  config read ends the check before `git status` starts. It never runs
  the repo's own code: fsmonitor, hooks and repo-configured clean filters are
  disabled, and submodules are compared by commit only.
- Quotas show what the shared client holds: after a failed refresh the last
  feed stays until it is older than `quotaRefreshSeconds`, then the footer
  shows `Q unavailable`. A fetch that times out counts as failed. A new
  `quotaPort` hides quotas until the next fetch.
- TTFT and TPS are for the last reply.

## Tool

- `get_quotas({ provider? })`: one compact line per provider with percent
  left per bucket (the balance for a balance-only bucket, such as Codex
  credits, and used/limit counts where QuotaBar sends them); reset times only
  for buckets that are not healthy.

## Command

- `/quota`: the full feed (every bucket, reset time and status) as a
  notification.

## Polling

In TUI sessions the client refreshes the feed on `session_start` and every
`quotaRefreshSeconds`, and stops on shutdown, `/reload` and session switch.
Tool and command calls use a cached feed younger than the interval, else
fetch (8 s timeout; polling uses 5 s).

## `rig.json` settings (`status` section)

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `quota` | `true` | QuotaBar integration; `false` drops `get_quotas`, `/quota`, polling and the footer's `Q` segment (applies on `/reload`) |
| `quotaPort` | `8787` | QuotaBar.app feed port (1 to 65535) |
| `quotaRefreshSeconds` | `60` | Polling interval (5 to 3600) |

Other changes made with `/rig` apply immediately: a new port drops the cached feed,
and a new interval restarts polling.
